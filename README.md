# eyedroid
eyedroid is a program for detecting objects or class of objects based on a given pattern. Detection is done on  images and videos frames acquired trough a camera. When the searched object is found, the program makes a snapshot (if it's a video) or saves the coordinates of the objects if it's a single image.
